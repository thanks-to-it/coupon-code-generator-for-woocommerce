Generate coupons in WooCommerce. Beautifully.

== Description ==

The **Smart Coupon Generator for WooCommerce** plugin lets you enable automatic coupon code generation in WooCommerce.

### âœ… Main Features ###

* **Order Coupon** - generate coupon automatically for the selected order status updates. Coupon code will be automatically attached to the selected customer's emails.
* **Automatic Coupon Code** - generate coupon code automatically when adding new coupon in "Marketing > Coupons > Add coupon".

### ðŸš€ Automatic Order-Based Coupon Generator (in Emails) for WooCommerce ###

The "Smart Coupon Generator for WooCommerce" plugin is a dynamic tool designed to enhance your WooCommerce store's marketing and customer retention strategies.

This plugin streamlines the process of creating and distributing coupons by automating it based on order statuses.

Tailored to offer a personalized experience, it generates coupons as fixed amounts or percentages, catering to various customer interactions and purchase behaviors.

### ðŸš€ Automated Coupon Creation Based on Order Status ###

Automatically create coupons triggered by specific order statuses, such as "Order Completed".

This feature allows you to reward customers post-purchase or encourage further engagement, enhancing customer loyalty and satisfaction.

### ðŸš€ Select Which Emails to Include Coupon In ###

Incorporate coupons into specific customer emails, such as "Order Completed" notifications. This targeted delivery ensures that your coupons are seen and used at critical points in the customer journey, maximizing their impact.

### ðŸš€ Customizable Coupon Templates - Personalized Design with Dynamic Placeholders ###

Personalize your coupons with a range of placeholders like `%order_id%`, `%order_billing_first_name%`, and `%order_customer_id%`.

This customization ensures that each coupon feels personal to the recipient, increasing its perceived value and effectiveness.

### ðŸš€ Restrict Coupon Usage by Email ###

Secure your promotional strategies by limiting coupon usage to the email address associated with the billing information of the order. By doing this, you guarantee that your coupons are exclusively used by the intended recipients, enhancing the effectiveness of your campaigns and preventing misusing coupons (or selling them).

### ðŸš€ Set Spending Limits for Coupon Eligibility ###

Implement minimum and maximum spending thresholds to be able to use the coupons. This way, you can only make coupons work when customers have at at least $100 in cart (or not exceeding specific amount), to ensure the profitability of your promotions.

### ðŸš€ Advanced Automatic Coupon Code Generator ###

Other than order statuses, you can facilitate effortless coupon creation with advanced options for automatic coupon code generation.

You can automate creating the coupon when adding new coupon in "Marketing > Coupons > Add coupon" page without manual code entry.

Customize the code template using placeholders like `%date_MM%` or `%user_id%`, and define the code style (hash, random letters, numbers, mix) and length.
